I did a funny retrospective last time. One of my hobby is playing Pen&Paper Games (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game)
and I tried to combine this with a Retrospective. I have divided the retro into the following sections (Sorry some of the Pictures have german Text, but should be enough to get an idea of it):

# 1. Find a hero group
*Time: 15 min - 20 min*

Anyone gets a very small character sheet where he can create a hero which should represent himself in a fantasy middle-age setting and must have:
- A name (e.g. Sir Thomet)
- A race (e.g. Dwarf)
- A class (e.g. Knight)
- A Level (e.g. 66/100, I sad, find your own scale which can be different to each member)
- 3 Main Attributes: Body, Agility and Mind; The sum of all 3 attributes must be 100% (e.g. Body: 25%, Agility: 40%, Mind: 35%)
- A weapon (e.g Warhammer)
- A armour if you character have one (e.g. plate armor)
- One ore more Magic spell(s) (e.g. Reparus - Can repair everything)
- A slogan (e.g. Mess with the best die like the rest)

After creation everyone tells shortly about is hero (this is more a fun section and helps to train the self image and to dive into in the fantasy retrospective)

# 2. The Journey
*Time: 45 min*

In this section we did look back on our sprint Journey. The quest (sprint backlog) we started with and the the way to the goal (the sprint goal). That means having a look on all tickets which we worked on. The hero group
tolled me, what each ticket represents in the journey. E.g. a ticket where the way was clear but hard was a representation of a mountain within our journey. There are also other tickets they are
lakes where you need to build a bridge, forests where you can get lost, a side quest (e.g. not sprint goal related ticket) or sometimes only a normal way (easy task) or a small village where you can have a rest (and many more).

With that we got a journey map and we talked about all out tickets from the sprint and how they affected us.

# 3. Monsters, Traps and Treasures
*Time: 5 min to write down, 10 min to present*

Now the heros find out Monsters (e.g. big things to deal with), Traps (e.g. Wrong decisions) and Treesures (e.g. learn a lot about something). They write them on cars and present them after some time to everyone.

# 4. Tell the bard
*Time: 30 min*

After each journey the heros go the a Tavern to celebrate the adventure. And there will always be a Bard who will listen and tell about hero stories. Now the heros must tell the Bard the most 3 important things (Vote) in his journey.
That can be something like: which was very well, something they will do in a different way next time

They will talk about the 3 topcis separately and decide if they will do it the same way next time or if now, how they will handle it next time (write down TODOs if needed)

# 5. Feedback
*Time: 10 min*

Everyone can tell 1-2 sentece about the retrospective

# Closing
This Retrospective make a lot of fun, promotes creativity and is a very good variety. The participants had some start difficulties but after building the heroes they got it. I got very good feedback and the result was also very good. I recommend to anyone to be creative with your retrospectives.
